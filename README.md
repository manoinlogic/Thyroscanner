# Thyro
An AI-powered system using ensemble learning techniques for accurate classification of thyroid diseases.
you have to install packages in appropriate path where the project is and i mentioned the required packages in requirement.txt file.
you have to intall the python version 3.10 so the important packages can be installed(ex tensorflow,pillow etc).
and while installing packages the argon2 package cant be added for that you have to install(pip install argon2-cffi).
it is a better one for final year projects.
